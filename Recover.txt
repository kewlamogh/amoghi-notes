[ela] [adolphus hitler] Anti-Setimitism was so pervasive in Europe that A Hitler didn't even need to put in much effort to make it.  His wild assumptions were myth making. He purposefully created a narrative, playing on people's ingrained prejudices, in which the Aryan people (those who invaded north india and spoke an Indo-European language) were good, hard-working, and holy. Wheareas Hitler painted a heavily biased view of Jews. His work made Jews the scapegoat of all the problems of the Aryans.

[hitler] My feelings as a Christian point me to my Lord and Saviour as a fighter. It points me to the man who once in loneliness, surrounded only by a few followers, recognized these Jews for what they were and summoned men to fight against them and who, God‚Äôs truth, was greatest not as a sufferer but as a fighter. In boundless love as a Christian and as a man I read through the passage which tells us how the Lord at last rose in His might and seized the scourge to drive out of the Temple the brood of vipers and adders. How terrific was His fight for the world against the Jewish poison. To-day, after two thousand years, with deepest emotion I recognize more profoundly than ever before in the fact that it was for this that He had to shed His blood upon the Cross. As a Christian I have no duty to allow myself to be cheated, but I have the duty to be a fighter for truth and justice.... And if there is anything which could demonstrate that we are acting rightly it is the distress that daily grows. For as a Christian I have also a duty to my own people.... When I go out in the morning and see these men standing in their queues and look into their pinched faces, then I believe I would be no Christian, but a very devil if I felt no pity for them, if I did not, as did our Lord two thousand years ago, turn against those by whom to-day this poor people is plundered and exploited.-- Hitler

[math] to get the distance from speed and time, just multiply the speed and time. <br> Eg., speed is 3 inches per minute and time is 5 minutes, then I move 15 inches.

[math] speed is a rate (usually unit) that compares distance and time; in an equation, s = d/t. Algebra can be applied to get the time or distance given the opposite and the speed. speed is a human concept - an indirect measurement.

[public speaking] anti-semitism existed for many years in europe. By painting a picture that jews were fat rich people, he makes the audience believe that the jews profited. Though they didn't. Hitler made this the backbone of his political campaign. Though my dad tells me that hitler did that because he just wanted a rallying point - a reason to fight.
